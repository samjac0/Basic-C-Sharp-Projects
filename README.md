# Basic C-Sharp Projects
 
This repository has various C-Sharp projects that showcase what I have learned through my time in software developer bootcamp.

### TwentyOne Game
A more-robust console app that takes a player through a twenty one game. Scaffolding is structured to allow more games in the app with minimal concern by utilizing generic/abstract classes. Notable elements include a db method that logs errors, shuffledeck, busted boolean, betting, and leaving the table once the player is out of money.

### Car Insurance Portal
Using Asp.Net, I created a simple protal that intakes insurees and goes through a fake underwritting process, then delivers a quote to the "admin" page. Project utilizes Bootstrap, EntityFramework, and various C# methods allowing a user to edit/delete Insurees. 

### DateTime
A simple program showing the ability to understand and manipulate Asp.Net Core using razor. It displays the Date and time.

In addition to the above, other console apps are included that show competency in the following: DateTime, Methods, Lists, Arrays, Classes, Math, Parsing, etc.
