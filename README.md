### Project 1
Description

### TwentyOne Game
A more-robust console app that takes a player through a twenty one game. Scaffolding is structured to allow more games in the app with minimal concern by utilizing generic/abstract classes. Notable elements include a db method that logs errors, shuffledeck, busted boolean, betting, and leaving the table once the player is out of money.

### Car Insurance Portal
Using Asp.Net, I created a simple protal that intakes insurees and goes through a fake underwritting process, then delivers a quote to the "admin" page. Project utilizes Bootstrap, EntityFramework, and various C# methods allowing a user to edit/delete Insurees.
